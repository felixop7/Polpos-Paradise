# Team Polpo's Paradise

Our innovative system provides a convenient and flexible method for addressing locations, catering to both **public** and **private** needs. Whether you're looking to establish a unique identity for your residence or simply share a general location, Polpo's Paradise has you covered.


# **Introduction**

Polpo's Paradise is a groundbreaking approach to house numbering, designed to simplify location identification while offering flexibility in sharing your address. Our system utilizes a structured format that combines essential geographic information to create a comprehensive and user-friendly addressing system.

**Key Features**

1.  **Convenience and Precision**: Polpo's Paradise enables you to choose the level of detail you wish to share. By providing District, Municipality, and Ward information, you can allow others to approximate your location easily. If you're comfortable sharing more specific details, such as your House Number, others can pinpoint your exact location with precision.
    
2.  **Private and Public Usage**: The system is designed to cater to both privacy concerns and public needs. If you choose not to share your House Number, others can still accurately identify your general location. This feature is ideal for scenarios where you want to communicate your area without divulging your exact address.
    
3.  **Benchmarked Location**: We've integrated a unique benchmarking approach by designating the center of each Ward as a landmark. This central point serves as a reference for measuring distance and direction. By providing a certain distance from this central point, along with the chosen direction, you're enabling others to navigate to your location efficiently.
    
4.  **User-Friendly Navigation**: Polpo's Paradise makes navigation simple. Our predefined cardinal directions (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW) combined with distance measurements help people locate your place without hassle.
    
5.  **Flexible Addressing**: Whether you're ordering food for delivery, providing directions to guests, or sharing your location on social media, our system adapts to your needs. Share as much or as little information as you prefer.

## **Usage**

To use Polpo's Paradise, simply follow this format:

`District-Municipality-WardNo-Direction-Distance(in m)-HouseNumber(for private use)`

For example:

-   Public Location: `Kavre-D-1-W-900`
This indicates that the house is around at 900M West from the center benchmark(that we made) of Ward NO. 1,Dhulikhel Municipality, Kavre District. 
-   Private Location: `Kavre-D-1-W-900-5`
This private location gives the exact pin point of the Main Gate of the House no 5 located at 900M West from the center benchmark(that we made) of Ward NO. 1,Dhulikhel Municipality, Kavre District.
(**For consistency and ease of understanding, starting from North and proceeding in a clockwise direction (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW) might be the most intuitive choice.**)
